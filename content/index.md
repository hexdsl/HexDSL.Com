Hi, I'm HexDSL. I post about all sorts of things. There really is no theme. I post about things I think about and a lot of it is random rambling and book/writing talk. If you are here for my social links or a discord invite, please click on [[Socials]] for all that stuff. If you have a comment question, then please email me or use Discord. I answer mail that comes to [hexdsl@gmail.com](mailto:hexdsl@gmail.com), I welcome writing thoughts and questions.

This website is powered by Obsidian, which means that the sidebar, to the left, is very intractable and the site wide search is also very responsive. I encourage you to use that side bar for older posts, as there is much more than the list below may indicate.
