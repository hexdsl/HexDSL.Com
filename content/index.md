Hi, I'm HexDSL. I post about all sorts of things. There really is no theme. I post about things I think about and a lot of it is random rambling and book/writing talk. If you are here for my social links or a discord invite, please click on [[Socials]] for all of that. If you have a comment question, then please email me or use Discord. I answer mail that comes to [hexdsl@gmail.com,](mailto:hexdsl@gmail.com) I welcome writing thoughts and questions.

>  This website has recently switched its 'back end' from Obsidian-Publish to Quartz. As such, you may find some oddity or broken links. HexDSL is working on it. I promise! 
> 

This website is now powered by [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz), which means that the sidebar, to the left, is very intractable, and the site-wide search is also very responsive. I encourage you to use that sidebar for finding posts, as there is much more than the list below *may* indicate.

# 📰 Posts & Articles
You can read my most recent story right here:
➡️ 📖 [Chronicles of Ned: Space, to breathe](<Writing/ChroniclesOfNed/Space, to Breathe/Start Here.md>) 🚀

If you have read any of the Denouement books that I have written, you may find this interesting:
➡️ 📖 [Denouement 'wiki'](<Writing/Denouement/Denouement notes.md>)

⏭️ If you want posts, I got posts. They are in the side-bar over there on the left, also the recent posts are on the right... in the section marked 'Recent' - Which, I feel may be, a little on the nose, but I'm pretty sure you got this. 💋

# 🔗Here are some various links
- 📚 [[My Books]] ⬅️ *I write!*
- 🦠 [Micro Blog](https://getupnote.com/share/notes/AUiZ14tRv0anStjXFyr6Xg51TGB3/3d37c69e-e152-4dee-a1cb-e63fd10b8c94) ⬅️ Fun talking to myself
- 😘 [[About HexDSL]] ⬅️OMG! That's me!
- 🦩 [[Socials]] ⬅️ Discord and Email... really, that's is.

## 🌃 My current priorities
1. ✍️ writing **Denouement Part 3**.
2. 💼 Working 40 hours a week at my *actual* job.
4. 🥰 Be grateful for all the wonderful things in life, every day!
