Given that this seems like a rather short post, I'll also spend a moment updating you on my current writing project.

The release of [[2023-10-07 - Nancy and Holmes any day now|Nancy and Holmes]] went well, but the problems with novels is that I won't get any feedback for weeks yet. ðŸ˜’

I rolled onto my next project within just a few days and am now 45 pages into the first *'Chronicles of Ned'* story.  A series of Novellas which chronicle the adventures of a character named Ned... Obviously.

The lead character, Ned, is the most unlikely hero, he has no skills, no charm and no idea what's happening when he meets aliens, ghosts, goblins and, vampires he has to rely on luck, lies and a Viking to save his useless posterior. 

Ned has only one thing going for him. He is genetically predisposed to attract the odd, unusual, alien and strange. He is quite literally a magnet for mayhem and no one wishes they could turn it off more than him.

This one has been a lot of fun to write, so far. 

*As usual I would like to remind you all that you can get any of my writing via the [[../../Website/My Books|My Books]] page or send me an email and I will send you an ePub upon request.*
