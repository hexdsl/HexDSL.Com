Merry Christmas one and all. This year due to time restrictions, my friend and I were not able to have a script showdown, like last year. 

With this in mind, I present to you my own script offering. 

**A time to be married.** 
Please enjoy... or don't. I don't mind. ![[Files/Beige and White Scrapbook World Art Day Museum Exhibition Poster.jpg|500]]
