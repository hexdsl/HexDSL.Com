Its a struggle to find good information about GROFF, guides/examples and help files are few and far between but fear not the GNU project has your back...

I had been working with GROFF for weeks before I found an entire text book with the command

```
info groff
```

Its a great book with a bad interface but you can
```
info groff > A FILE
```
and then enjoy it via VIM

helps this helps some people like it helped me :)
