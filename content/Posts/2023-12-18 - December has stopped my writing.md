December is a monster. Between work, family and social commitments, I have been struggling to get any really quality writing time into my recent days.

Then, this week I have had a monster cold which has eaten my ability to think rationally.

Then there was the triumphant return to using scrivener instead of Microsoft Word as my main drafting hole. Taking up two days of re-learning things.

Then, next week, I have some extra days off. Will I get some proper writing time in? Nope, because Christmas is happening and ill be spending quality time with family, or friends.

Think is though, even through sickness, December and Scrivener has eaten my recent writing time. I have had an oddly enjoyable month.

Be cool December, you doin' okay.
