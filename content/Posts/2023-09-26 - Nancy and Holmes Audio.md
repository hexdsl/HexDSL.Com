_-- COMING SOON --_
It feels a little strange to have done no editing and no writing in almost two weeks. Instead, I've been reading aloud my recently finished project 'Nancy & Holmes.' intending to put the reading on YouTube, at the same time as the Amazon and Itch release.

According to my tracking software ([ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/), its open source) I have spent over ten hours so far recording audio and I'm only halfway through. I still have to combine files, add chapter change sound-stingers, compress, normalise and tweak the audio.

It's a strangely satisfying project which is, oddly, scratching the same part of my brain as the actual writing does. Also, I have caught two typos that I had previously missed! - Go me!

Anyway, I tell you this, so you know why I have been a failing to output YouTube videos and regular blogs. I assure you though, when I release a book and a ten hour(ish) YouTube audio-file, you will see where the time went

## Software chices

At the moment, I'm recording using Audacity. Despite its recent, rightfully given, bad press and the fact that it looks and feels like an application from 1801, I can't find a better application for just scrubbing and recording audio. If you know of something, please let me know in Discord or via e-mail. I would like something that doesn't look like it was made in visual-basic '95.

## Hardware

Using my laptop (XPS-13 9315... I think) and a Blue Snowball with a Batman sock over the top. I'm not sure the Batman sock is relevant to sound quality, but it does work as a very basic pop filter.

## Is it good?

I realise the audio could be better, but it's one of those times when I don't know if it's worth investing in a recording shield, pop filter and maybe even a new mic when the views may be in single figures.

Also, it's still me recording it, so it's always going to sound like a stupid Brummie did it. So, there's that.

What I have done is put work into making it sound as good as possible with my current hardware and will spend a lot of time in the post-recording section cleaning it up.

## Is this a viable business model?

lol! No.

The audio will be on YouTube, freely. The book will be on Amazon and Itch, for under £3 _(or, in the case om Amazon, as cheap as I can make it)_

The hope is that I get enough 'views' on YouTube to make it worth the effort and at least some of those people pick it up in eBook format. Though, I honestly don't expect to make actual money from this project. Realistically, if I did this for money, looking for a publisher would be the smart play.

Also, I have a Patreon, if you worry I wont eat. And all ~~food~~ support is welcome. - The Patreon is linked under ever YouTube video and the books are linked on this site.

Thanks for reading. More updates soon™️
