I realise that in recent months I have been less productive. This is because I have been deep in my writing hole. 

Many of you who follow closely will know that I have been working on "Nancy & Holmes" a story which came to me at three in the morning, many months ago.

The novel is about 110k words and features a 'ghost detective,' alcoholism, death, and the occult. It's a good time and there are 100% absolutely no space-ships, for once. 

Since its initial conception, the story has progressed and changed and mutated and grown. My good friend [Wing](https://feather.onl) has just finished the proof-reading of my 'final' draft. He has made many corrections and given me some notes on the story, which were universally great!

I have to make some more changes, though, thankfully none of them are structural in nature and none are massive endeavours. 

I have one more minor edit-pass and a last proof read and it will be made available to you all. - I am currently planning on a November release. 

## Publication?
The question this time, though, is about distribution. My investigations into publishing without Amazon exclusivity have been somewhat patchy. I would, ideally, like to publish via Itch, and Itch alone, but I have not seen a viable readership from there.

If you have thoughts or preferences about any of this, then please let me know.

## Workflow
As you may have noticed, when I get this far into a project, I like to take a snapshot of my workflow.

As it is, I'm still writing all of my words in Word, despite my desire to find something more *long-form* focused. As far as I can tell, there just isn't a tool which work as well as Word, for the actual writing.

I love scrivener, but having to change tools between the writing and the collaborative revision phase makes it a chore to use. 

For notes and writing wiki, I'm currently using Obsidian and am planning on making my writing notes/lore archive public here eventually (probably soon.)

For grammar support I'm still using [[../../Software Notes/ProWritingAid|ProWritingAid]] which I still think is a fantastic tool. Won't be changing that.

For lookups, [WordHippo](https://www.wordhippo.com/) is still my tool of choice. 

At it stands, unless I manage to afford a [[../../Software Notes/Dabble Writer|Dabble Writer]] lifetime account, I really can't see my workflow changing anytime soon. 

## Final thoughts
If you have any questions about my writing or process, please do message me via the email address below or use Discord to contact me. I am most happy to talk about writing all day long with anyone who is interested ðŸ˜Š
