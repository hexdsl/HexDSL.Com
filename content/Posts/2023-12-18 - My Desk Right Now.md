Well....

Not a lot going on at the moment...

- Same monitor as last time
- Same coffee things as last time
- I broke my monitor arm, so I switched back to the Yeti, which is actually working okay, finally.
- I moved to an M2 MacBook Air recently and ended up using all the Magic accessories. Which, as it turns out, are really good, (or at least I really like them, I'm not sure.) Anyway, it's on a shelf.
- The Bible is the same on as last time too, I think.
