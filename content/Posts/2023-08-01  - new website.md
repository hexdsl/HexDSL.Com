## What's Happening?

I know that change is scary, I get that. I really do.
And I know that a lot of you really liked the Notion driven web page. But, let's be real here. The notion driven page was a bear, it was slow and a lot of people had issue navigating it. Now, I still love me some Notion, but I think it's pretty fair to say that for most people, this now Obsidian powered website will be a much better offering.

Over the next few days I'll be converting the posts from notion over to this platform and after a few weeks, nothing will have been lost, and, if anything did fail to move over, it is still accessible on [this](https://hexdsl.notion.site/HexDSL-com-d774fe34648f4166a5d53d3de9966d8e?pvs=4) link.  I'm pretty sure that there will be changes coming to the **Trendy Talk** website in coming weeks too.

In the near future you can expect:

- A working "index" page, so you don't have to self serve from the side bar.
- The sharing of my personal writing wiki (the lore for all by fiction works.)
- Some automated sharing of books and articles I enjoyed.
- A better layout, because, at the moment its all defaults.
