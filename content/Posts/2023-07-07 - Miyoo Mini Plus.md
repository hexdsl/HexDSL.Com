📆 Post date: 07-07-2023

I recently had the urge to play some old Megadrive (Genesis) games. I dusted off my old Retoflag GPI Gameboy style handheld and, well, just sort of blinked at it for a moment. It was big and chunky, like a Gameboy, which was great but it has over a minute boot up time, and takes AA batteries.

Knowing a few years had passed since I picked it up, I had a quick google and to my absolute shock, stunningly, there’s been quite a bit of movement in this space. I stumbled first on a £6 Gameboy on TEMU claiming to sport 400 games, so, obviously I ordered it.

Crappy £6 Game boy!

It arrived, and, as expected was a total turkey that just had 400 random NES games preloaded and no method to load new roms (yes, i took it to bits to check for memory card slot.) It did however, have a  pretty good form-factor, weighed a lot less than my Retroflag and came on _instantly(ish.)_ My mind was ser, now I ******************needed******** a good handheld.

After some poking around forums and watching some YouTube videos I decided I wanted something like a Miyoo Mini Plus, then, to my shock the actual device was in stock on the Droix store website.

I ordered it, it arrived with no issue, costing around £68 (if i recall.)

The device was loaded with a an operating system that was essentially shite. I had prepared though and already downloaded OnionOS, a user made open source RetroArch powered OS for it. It’s worth knowing that you must run the Onion OS beta in order to use it on a “plus” model.

_Please make sure you get the right version, or it won’t boot._

After some basic SD card formatting and tinkering I had the OS set up on a 128GB card.  All I needed to do then was load some NOT ILLEGAL TOTALLY LEGITIMATE ROMS!

I loaded them on, used the “Skraper” application to get the artwork for the games (the OnionOS wiki told me how to do this.) Now, after a few pleasantly spent says of tinkering and loading games on it, i have what maybe the perfect retro gaming box, for me.

☝ **Pros**

- Small
- Nice buttons
- Good screen
- Wi-Fi! _(for retro achievements!)_
- Reasonable price
- Software easy to setup and use
- Quick start-up (few seconds)

👇 **Cons**

- No Bluetooth or USB data, so I can’t use external controllers.
- Screen glass/plastic is SUPER soft, I recommend a screen protector, right away.
- Speaker is middling at best.
- No TV out of any kind.

With my 128GB SD card, I have all the games I would ever want (8 and 16 bit) including some larger file size Sega CD titles and some PS1 games.  I don’t feel like the device is missing anything at all and at this time it’s the best Shining Force experience I could ask for 🤤

The 640x480 (IPS) screen make games look great, with the smaller screen size some of these old games could be mistaken for newer indie titles.

Honestly, I can’t think of a reason to buy any other handheld at the moment, unless someone makes a clamshell with similar OS, I’ll be playing this for many years to come.

Games I have played a LOT OF on this handheld in include:

- FC - NES Open golf
- MD - Shining Force (1)
- SFC - Zombies ate my Neighbours
- GG - Crystal warriors
- MD - Alien Storm
- FC - The Least Star Fighter

(happy to test any game on request)
