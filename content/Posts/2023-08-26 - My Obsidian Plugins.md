# Plugins! 
Okay, so when it comes to web browsers I have something of a mantra - "Every plugin is a security risk" - Many times i have had a cool browser extension/plugin/addon and a week later its serving me ads or making dubious connections. Now, I am very selective. 

With Obsidian however, I have a little more confidence, as there is at least some vetting going on before the appear in the community 'gallery.'

Still though, I'm going to list all my plugins here and what I use-case I have.  This doesn't mean I wont change them in a few weeks/days or even hours. It also doesn't mean that they are the best ways to get things done. It's a statement of what I currently use, that's all.

I made a video -  [The Obsidian Plugins I use. (A long, probably boring video) - YouTube](https://youtu.be/F0239G2oFMI)

Yes, there are currently a lot 

Name | what is does for me 
-----|------------------
better word count | Word count, but better.                                                           
canvas-presentation | Lets you do an interesting canvas animation
syntax-highlight | Code highlighting for your dataview and code blocks 
typewriter-scroll | Typewriter scrolling fixes the curser location (on a line) and then scrolls the page around it. Most long form writers like it but its not for everyone.
customjs | Lets me use JS in Obsidian (datadiew)
dataview | Lets you run live queries in obsidian. I use it for filtering and summary.
file explorer note count | Puts number in the self side bar explorer and tells me how many notes each folder contains
highlightr-plugin | Easy Markdown highlighting (good for research)
link-favicon | When you put a link in, it adds the favicon, just a little pointless visual tweak, but i like it 
longform | This is the best way to write longform in obsidian. It makes obsidian work like Scrivener, though, I don't use it because I don't actually 'novel' in Obsidian (I use Word)                                   
advanced-slides | You like slideshow's, made in Obsidian? so do I! this gives you theme options, which are nice, as well as a live preview.
auto-link-title | Paste link, get markdown formatted version, that snags title from webpage title. I like it.           
obsidian-banners | Can give you notion style headers and icon setup. I have this turned off at the moment and have not missed it.
bible-reference | Looks up and format's bible referenced in Markdown Callouts. 
book-search-plugin | Click the button, lookup the book, make a new file. Then make notes about book. Its what I use on the public page for my book note starting bits. 
dictionary-plugin | I don't think either of us need me to explain a 'dictionary,' or why its useful... do we? 
emoji-toolbar | I mapped a hot key to `alt+;` and I get a little menu (like the windows one) for emoji. Its great because it shows the emoji how it will look when obsidian renders it
excalidraw-plugin | Little drawings, as notes. Endlessly useful! (I never use it.)
excel-to-markdown-table | Paste from excel, to Obsidian and it converts it to a markdown table.
obsidian-fountain | Fountain is a bit like markdown for screenplays. This allows Obsidian to render it.                       
obsidian-linter | Did you make ugly markdown? don't worry linter fixes that for you.
obsidian-minimal-settings | So this is a settings menu for the 'minimal' theme. I know that sounds mad, but the minimal theme really is the only theme you need.
obsidian-outliner | Lots of tweaks including the ability to move lines with keyboard shortcut and moving bullets with a mouse
obsidian-pandoc | Pandoc powered export (for me, it gets me to docx.)
obsidian-plugin-update-tracker | little icon in system tray that checks for plugin updates and a one-click update all.
obsidian-quiet-outline | Enhanced outliner side bar. Better than stock because its colour coded and has auto expanding
reading-time | How long to read the page you are looking at? - this is a good status bar plugin.
sort-and-permute-lines | I use this simply to get a hotkey to sort selected lines.  
obsidian-sortable |  Makes tables sortable (like Wikipedia.)                                                 
obsidian-timeline | Cool little timeline renderer. Not used it much but I have a project planned for it.     
toggle-meta-yaml-plugin | Toggle front matter visibility (I dont use this much, I like front matter, mostly.)
trash-explorer | I move deleted filed to a `.trash` folder, rather than deleting them on the file system. This is how I manage that.         
omnisearch | A better search interface if the built in one fails you. Good for large vaults, I'm told.
quickadd | Lets me script entry of data into files (sort of) and then add a hot key.
readwise-official | I love Readwise and this is the way I bring it into Obsidian. Works great.
recent-files | Gives me a 'recent' panel which i keep always visible. Great for quick switching.
tag-wrangler | I use predominantly, tags. This lets me fix typos and merge them from the side bar.
typing-speed | Silly little plugin that puts my typing speed on the status bar. its useless but I enjoy it.
url-into-selection | Select some text. Paste a link. not the text is a link. 
various-complements | Auto completion engine for note text.
