**Type** - City
**Location** - [[Earth (Sol)]]
The capital city of Earth, the country formerly known as England is now just Victoria City. The whole thing.

Generally sunny there, usually presented as late afternoon. early summer.

# Description
City is patrolled by Police drones that are pyramidal. It is governed by a single AI that looks for illegal/dangerous activity.
A Modern city trying to evoke feelings of classical Victorian England. Its a theme park more than a city, its trying to make you feel safe and entertained rather than being a real place like Central. Even [[Canto (Central Prime)]] is less of a contrived theme than Victoria.
**Sounds:** Happy people, little shuttles and children laughing.
**Smell:** Crisp summer air and fresh cut grass. A flurry of artificial wholesomeness
