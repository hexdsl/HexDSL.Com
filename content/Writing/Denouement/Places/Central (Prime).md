Type - Planets

Controller - [[../Races and factions/Vampire (Race)|Vampire (Race)]]

Central was one of three Earth-sized planets orbiting a young sun. It was a little larger than Sol. Central, our destination, had two moons and one massive spaceport in orbit. The other two planets in the system had essentially become industrial infrastructure over the years. It would take us an hour to get to the Centralâ€™s surface now, and then a little walk and we would be home.
