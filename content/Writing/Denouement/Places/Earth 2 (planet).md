**Type** - Planet
**Location** - At the edge of old Thinker space
The Spare Earth that Aygah stored for “reasons.”

# Role in Story  
The planet was in Thinker space until after the fall. The Thinkers had ignored all of their Young races and because of this may not have even known that the place existed. Jonathan located it by following his chain of “feelings” and discovering it, he guesses via [[../People/Aygah|Aygah's]] plan. 

The Planet is in roughly 2020’s levels of technology and is supposed to offer the reader a glimpse into how Denoumeverse technology is, when framed against ours. 

 When it is first introduced as part of the D3 story it is in the midst of a heat wave. 

**Unique Features:** A spare earth, and one that appears to be an artefact from another iteration.
