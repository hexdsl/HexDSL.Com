Type - Space Station

Controller - [[../Races and factions/Human (Race)|Human (Race)]]

A sol way station at the edge of Sol space.

Pickup point in D2 “Rim and Blade” where the gang pickup Libby.

# Description
> Eadred station was possibly the least ‘Sol’ station in the Sol alliance. It was dirty, old and in an awful state of repair. On the far edge of alliance space, the last stop before the rim. I quiet liked the ageing perfection vibes it gave off. From the outside, it looked like a large round cake, with the upper and lower layers being docking ports and the thinner ‘filling’ portion being the living and commerce area. Stations like this were always made of mostly docks and cargo holds, and little else. (D2, Rim)
