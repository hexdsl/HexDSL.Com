# 🔧Type of technology
An energy shield type made from surface projected [[Blue-Energy]] which, once stable resists all pressure and gasses in two directions.

The size of the shield is dictated by the field projector and no 'catching' device it required. Gaps in the field seal can be intentionally created in order to allow oxygen. Sometimes the shield is osculated in order to allow free travel of air, or, a breeze in some cases. 

First used in [[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] apartment in [[../Story notes/Denouement 1|Denouement 1]] after the first attack on him, in his home. 

# **🖼️Description** 
Blue shields produce no heat and are safe to touch.
