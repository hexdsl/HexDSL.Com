# 🔧Type of technology
A type of  [[Blue-Energy]]  implementation which generates thrust via projecting raw energy outward from the panel emitter. 

This is a type of cold thrust for sub-light speeds and produces no harmful radiation.

Thrust panels can be configured under ship shielding or as smoked glass frames (far cheaper implementation)
