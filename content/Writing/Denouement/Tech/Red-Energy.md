# üîßType of Technology
Red-Energy is a cousin to [[Blue-Energy]]. It is far less controlled than Blue-Energy but has a larger theoretical power output and by nature of not being the same energy-type it is resistant to different types of energetic attacks. 

Red-Energy  was never invented on the final iteration of reality. It's brutality and raw output power is not at all the same kind of refined control and elegant design which is prevalent in [[../Races and factions/Elder (Faction)|Elder (Faction)]] technology, and hence, the rest of the civilized universe.  

Unlike Blue-Energy Red-Energy can also be powered by energetic attacks. In [[../Story notes/Denouement 2|Denouement 2]] this was used to keep a personal shield perpetually charged and in a morally dubious defence it was even used to absorb and kill [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinker (Race)]] attacks. 

The only example of this technology is found on [[../Ships/Basilica (Starship)|Basilica (Starship)]], which was brought this iteration by [[../People/Aygah|Aygah]] herself. Because of their work with the power system on Basilica, [[../People/Alin of Kein|Alin of Kein]] and [[../People/Libby Michaels|Libby Michaels]] have replicated the technology but the [[../Races and factions/Followers (Faction)|Followers (Faction)]] have decided that it is of more use to keep the technology to themselves. 

Red-Energy  can be used for all use-cases which Blue-Energy can be utilised for however its raw power and lack of fine control doe not make it ideal how surface [[Thrust-Panel]] use. 

# **üñºÔ∏èDescription** 
Where [[Blue-Energy]] fields are often described as looking like still-waters and feeling like moving sand, cold to the touch. Red-Energy  fields are burning hot, looks like contained fire and lack any refinement at all.

The raw output of red-energy makes it a far more brutal weapon system though, which is a one reason that the [[../Races and factions/Followers (Faction)|Followers (Faction)]] have not shared the technology.

The Red-Energy generator about [[../Ships/Basilica (Starship)|Basilica (Starship)]] is the only thing that outputs enough raw energy to drive its iteration slicing propulsion engine.
