# Gravity-manipulation
## 💡 Details
Gravity manipulation is relatively old science which was developed by [[../Races and factions/Vampire (Race)|Vampire (Race)]] and [[../Races and factions/Elf (Race)|Elf (Race)]] independently. Once they met, they trended towards free sharing of technology and refined it the point of triviality for ship-scale manipulation.

Once this was combined with [[Blue-Energy]] creatively by Vampire scientist, we had the basics of modern gravity-panelling in place and this was then converted into the underpinning technology of [[Thrust-Panel]].
