A usage for [[Blue-Energy]], specifially a type of [[Blue-Shield]].
# 🔧Type of technology
The tubes can be used to pickup or lower cargo for for ship to ship fuel transfers.

A tube of blue energy is created between two locations, then with repulse technology (blue cushions) and pressure generation the contents of the tube can be pushed or pulled between the two points. 

This is used, primary for retrieval of crashed shuttles, large cargo items.

It has been used by [[../People/Libby Michaels|Libby Michaels]] to collect her team from an almost destroyed ship, deep inside a suns energy field. The team only survived because a medical team was on stanby on the star ship Mercia (the destination)
