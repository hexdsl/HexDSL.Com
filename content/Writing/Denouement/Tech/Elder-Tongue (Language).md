**Elder-Tongue language**
Linguistics • Ubiquitous in Elder Space.
Spoken by [[../Races and factions/Elder (Faction)|Elder (Faction)]] Races 
# **🖼️Description** 
The term Elder-race referred to the four races all of whom had natural Warps around their worlds. 

Due to [[../People/Aygah|Aygah]] and her tinkering they also all speak one language, which came to be known as ‘Elder-tongue’ there were iterations where the elder planets had many different languages, but it made more sense to Aygah if we all spoke a common one as it reduced the things for them to fight about. 

Interestingly it was assumed that there was a common ancestor among the races, an early space fairing race lost to the ages. Hence the idea that those who spoke the same language were ‘older’ than the others. I suppose it was true in many ways. I thought back to the earlier iterations.

# ⛲ Notable Features
Elder-Tongue is actually early modern English (Think Shakespeare) which was something Aygah enjoyed. She made it a unifying language for them, in part to entertain herself, she could have chosen almost anything, though as a native French speaker, that language would have made morse sense. 

# 📜Role in Story
> "I felt a smile creep over my face as I remembered. What we called Elder-tongue was actually something reminiscent of early modern English, Like someone once called Shakespeare spoke. Though there was literally no way anyone else alive could know that. I smiled to myself at the little secret that I couldn’t ever find a way to share with anyone."
