# 💡 Details
Young race. Fresh to civilized space 
> "*I walked right in, to see Kay talking to a person perched on a table. I didn’t recognise the species. Their skin was silver, the neck was the same width as their head. Rounded shoulders and they were wearing a well-worn tunic that would have been at home in the middle ages, though this wasn’t a completely alien garment on Central. Here you could dress however you wanted and no one much cared.* " - D2

> "*“No. It is welcome isn’t,” said the silver figure, nodding and turning towards me. I could see its thin lipless slit of a mouth and its black eyes. It had no nose to speak of. It looked vaguely fish-like but without the implied oiliness of that description. It raised a bare silver arm with a small hand at the end, the hand sported two fingers and a thumb. “He, lo,” it said as if it were two words. “Hello,” I replied walking closer to shake the odd hand.*" - D 2
