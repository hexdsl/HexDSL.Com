 A Warrior race from within the [[Brick (Race)]] Alliance space. They generally think of Bricks as good regents. But are a little resentful of the adoption of their laws.
## Type
Young
## Physical traits
Smaller heads than humans. Covered in fur of literally any colour. They all come from a planet within Brick territory and are considered to be a younger race.
# Homeworld
A sound that is not pronounceable by humans but when written in Elder is said to be called ‘Razzzlhanwa’ though when said by a feline is bares no similarity.
# Politics and Social
While they commonly work as security officers on Brick installations and stations most who leave their home world join a military within the alliance.
# Technology
Most of their technology is Brick gifted though, they have some very advanced martial arts that are native to their world
