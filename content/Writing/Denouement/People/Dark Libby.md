# 🗒️Notes

I don't know, a half baked idea about Libby doing shit she doesn't know about. I have no idea.

- Is Libby capable of lying to herself or is this some external force acting upon here?
- How does she deal with this when she finds out?
- What is dark Libby's agenda?
    - Is it just a hack?
    - Has someone stolen her?
    - What will **she** assume about this ?
- Is is the avatar that David Atkinson protected? Was Aygah somehow related? Did she fix it?
