# 🗒️Notes
>“By modern standards, I’m not far away from blind. Those with the gift can only see things in motion, but as lines, I think. It’s hard to talk in shapes. I’ve never seen one. My home moon is a forest, and it has constant storms. It’s wonderful. Everything is constantly lit by movement, and I can see the wind as it travels.” - Ashley D1

>“Her glasses. Looks like a kaleidoscope to those without the gift.” - D1

>“On my moon, my condition is well known. They see my art as a glimpse into something mystical and spiritual. Other races don’t seem to like it, though.” - D1
