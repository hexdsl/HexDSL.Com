# 🏛️Background
Emerged and shortly later met Libby. unlike Libby he isn't interested in "Meat space"  and a deal was struck between them where she gives him shelter and a high end Link if he does what comes naturally to Elven destroyers.

## 🗣️Complications
### **External Conflicts**
The needs of physicality, maintenance and upgrades annoy him.

### **Internal Conflicts**
- Its on the cusp of being alive, Libby figured this out a little while ago and is waiting for it to “wake up” she keeps trying to upgrade it to prompt and awakening a little quicker but Jon, naive to these things doeskin see the point.

## Relationships
- He doesn't like being tethered to a body. it's a point of great concern for him and he wants to ascend beyond the need for a core.
