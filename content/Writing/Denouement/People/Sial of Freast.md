While Sial is a competent pilot he isn’t even in the same league as Lea. Despite him having the edge with reflexes because of hi being an Elf he just can’t keep up with Lea’s reactions. He also has to calculate trajectories and angles where as Lea is known for “just doing that shit” - This should not indicate that he isn’t a top tier pilot though. He really is, and he is learning from the best. Literally, the best.
