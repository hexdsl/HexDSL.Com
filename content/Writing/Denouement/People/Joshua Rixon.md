Was adopted by Humans, was inspired to join Sol by Ba’an Ty’s life. Thats why he has a human name and human attitudes towards things. He basically ignores his Vampire origins and thinks of himself as human.

# 🗣️Complications

### **External Conflicts**

- He doesn’t get along with Vampires

### **Internal Conflicts**

- He knows that when his parents died, he would have been send back to Vampire space had he been born with wings. He’s resentful of this fact.
