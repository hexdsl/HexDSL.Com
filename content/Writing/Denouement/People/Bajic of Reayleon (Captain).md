# 🏛️Background

Worked his way up the Sol ranks. As an Elf it was a bold choice for him to join Sol rather than the Elven coalition.

## 🗣️Complications

### **External Conflicts**

-  Balancing Sol duties and Thinker agenda. He's got to fake it well enough that Sol don't catch on.

### **Internal Conflicts**

- The man is actaually dead, and a puppet for thinkers

# Relationships

-  Literally possessed by a Thinker at the time we meet him, so the person we met was dead, effectually he was never in the show

# 🗒️Notes

*Thinkers suck.*

Captain Bajic looked human at first, but from his slightly extended ears I assumed he has probably half elf. On his father’s side. He would have had the eyes too had it been his mother.
