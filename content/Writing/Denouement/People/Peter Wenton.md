**🎲Role in Story**: 

Peter Wenton assasin loon that shot at jo in the part in "tales from - monday"

> The man in the park was called Peter Wenton. He had a history of violence and was discharged from Sol force a few years earlier for attacking a Vampire officer and had been written up for insubordination a few times by other non-Human officers. I checked his personal log, which again, I should not have been able to do and…. Yep, he was here to assassinate the president. Oh dear. That was going to ruin out morning for sure. Not even seven and someone was about to pull a gun on us. Good job Sol force, train these mad bastards to shoot. Good job indeed.
