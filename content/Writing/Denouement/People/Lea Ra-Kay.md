# üóíÔ∏èNotes

**Flight lieutenant:** Wings as rank - Though becomes a 'Free General' in [[../Story notes/Tales of 1|Tales of 1]].

**Free-General:** 

>She flashed her circlet screen, showing her credentials, then pointed at the small pin she wore on her flight jacket. The security man leaned in a little to see it. The intricately designed piece of jewellery was a shiny red stone, it was edged with five shiny white rocks, I was told this was a rank insignia.

[[Aygah]] made her as Jon‚Äôs ‚Äú*backup*‚Äù and I think [[Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] may know.
Once described as the 'prettiest organic alive' by Libby. 

**Original notes:** Brick with long read hair, Medium height. A little curvier than Libby but well toned and graceful. Jon's best friend. Actually loves salad. Which is odd don't you think. She it Jon's personal pilot.
