# 🗒️Notes

Doesn’t like cheese. At Some point in the future (distant) she changes her profession and becomes an engineer because its compliments her role as doctor, she wants to treat all live, organic and non-organic. She see’s protecting life to be one of her primary responsibilities, though not sure why it feels so personal to her.

Black hair and darker skin tones like her mother. She is short and has an athletic build. She enjoys tightly fitted and revelling clothes. Like her mother she loves her Bio-Stasis but not as an adventurer without limits. 

She enjoy Bio-stasis because she will be young forever and refuses to allow social restrictions to prevent her from living like she is in her 20s. 

Her love of medicine was born from a desire to protect her 'gifts' and even share bio-stasis with others. *A dream she now now's to be dangerous.*
