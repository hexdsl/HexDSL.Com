Denouement is the name of my second book and the first in the Denouemeverse science-fiction setting. 

This section contains my live(ish) 'wiki' for the Denouement continuity. 

> [!danger] STOP!
> **If you have not read the Denouement books please be aware that there *will* be spoilers.** 
> Also, this is a live document and very much a work in progress, there is still quite a lot which is missing at this time.

This also contains unused plot points and stubs. The intent for this is to be used as a deeper reference for those who want it or an interesting look behind the curtain for those trying to write their own books.
