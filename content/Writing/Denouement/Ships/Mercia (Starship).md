**üìúRole in Story**: 
Mercia is a Kingdom Class starship of [[../Places/Earth (Sol)|Earth (Sol)]] and up until more kingdom class ships were built at the start of [[../Story notes/Denouement 3|Denouement 3]] the single most powerful ship in the galaxy.

Mercia is a ship built into/onto a large planetoid and contains enough weapons to take on an entire [[../Races and factions/Elder (Faction)|Elder (Faction)]] fleet on its own. 

[[../Races and factions/Human (Race)|Human (Race)]] got very good at two things, medical science and weapons. There is a poetry in them being good at to opposing things in this way.

Mercia is BIG. It is about 1/3 the size of Earths moon thought less uniformly round. When it is in orbit of a planet it has to use gravity correction technology to prevent tidal disruption.

Mercia contains a city, the mobile place of operation for [[../Places/Earth (Sol)|Earth (Sol)]] alliance governance, a large compliment of fighters (the largest outside of planetary defence reserves) omnidirectional weaponry, five power generation systems, a small city of people and at one point, a theme park. 

The internal structure is so large that it is split into zones such as commerce, recreation, housing, dock, industrial and operations.

It is capable of [[../Tech/TD-Drive|TD-Drive]] speeds (though due to its structure, it is limited in speed)

While it has a captain it also usually has a high ranking government compliment who arrange its 'missions,' the captain is responsible for maintenance and military operation only. 

Mercia is more than a ship, it is a statement form the [[../Races and factions/Human (Race)|Human (Race)]] that while they are the only [[../Races and factions/Elf (Race)|Elf (Race)]] without functional immortality, they are by no means children and *will* fight it pressed.

The very existence of Mercia has secured Earth's place as a major power in the galaxy. 

Mercia is the very definition of 'overpowered' and when it appears in orbit of a planet, it is visible from the surface and this statement alone, has resulted in wars ending.
