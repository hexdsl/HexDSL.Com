**üñºÔ∏èDescription**: 
A research ship of [[../Races and factions/Human (Race)|Human (Race)]] military. It is a mid-large size cruiser and was designed to research and scan space anomalies and map planets. 

captain [[../People/Bajic of Reayleon (Captain)|Bajic of Reayleon (Captain)]] was sent to support [[Thirteen (starship)]] in [[../Story notes/Denouement 2|Denouement 2]] but the ship had already been infiltrated by [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinker (Race)]] forces when it first entered the story.

It was brutally and completely defeated by the forces of [[../People/Gower Saint|Gower Saint]] and all [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinker's]] aboard were killed. This was the first time we saw a Thinker killed without massive preplanning. 

Penda was also home of doctor [[../People/Joshua Rixon|Joshua Rixon]] who was a being controlled by a Thinker and eventually attacked [[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] resulting in its own death. 
# **üèõÔ∏è Background**
Jon was unhappy that [[../People/Joanne Michaels (Jo)|Joanne Michaels (Jo)]] sent such a well equipped scanning ship to 'save him' when she knew that the technology the Thinkers had deployed was too dangerous to be logged and reproduced. 

He was also unimpressed the [[../Races and factions/Human (Race)|Human (Race)]] engineers repeatedly tried to scan [[Thirteen (starship)]], though once it was discovered that Thinkers had control of the ship this was obviously not at [[../People/Joanne Michaels (Jo)|Joanne Michaels (Jo)]] request.
