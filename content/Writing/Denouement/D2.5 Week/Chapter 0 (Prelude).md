# Preface - Week
This story is a ‘Tale from the Denouemeverse’ and may take place at any time in the over-all story/timeline. None of these stories are specifically plot sensitive and often take place in-between books however, they all add flavour to the Denouement universe. While they are all ‘cannon’ they are often tonally different from the main books and more often than not are slice-of-life - You can skip them, if you want. I will not hold it against you.
