All [[../../../../Website/About HexDSL|HexDSL]] works are related in small ways. This page outlines some of the ways in which the Denouement series is related to other series. 

# Hunters Gargden
- Hunters garden is a previous iteration of reality in which [[../People/Aygah|Aygah]] was merging supernatural creatures and modern society. 
- The daemon realms are accessed via local Warps holes, in the same way that Elder planets are accessed via Space Warp holes. 
# Nancy and Holmes
- Wraiths in Nancy and Holmes (and Hunters Garden) are early forms of [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinkers]]
# Chronicles of Ned
- Chronicles of Ned volume one has technological similarities to current Denouement reality.
- [[../Races and factions/Elf (Race)|Elf (Race)]] characters appear in Chronicles of Ned, volume one.
