# üí° Details
'In her we trust' picks up six weeks after the events of [[Denouement 1]] with our gang on the star ship Thirteen trying to stay out of trouble in deep space. 

The war between [[../Places/Earth (Sol)|Earth (Sol)]] and the [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinker (Race)]] is in full swing.

[[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] how has a fully restored memory and is enjoying it a great deal. He and [[../People/Libby Michaels|Libby Michaels]] enjoying time together. [[../People/Lea Ra-Kay|Lea Ra-Kay]] and the ships unexpected guest [[../People/Ba'an Ty|Ba'an Ty]] have formed an unlikely relationship. 

They reach their destination [[../Places/Central (Prime)#|Central (Prime)]] and start trying to find ways to live a new post [[Denouement 1]] life.

Eventually a visit from [[../People/David Atkinson|David Atkinson]] gets them involved with a religious cult called [[../Races and factions/Followers (Faction)|Followers (Faction)]]

An attack on the  [[../Races and factions/Brick (Race)|Brick (Race)]] home world while [[../People/Libby Michaels|Libby Michaels]] and [[../People/Lea Ra-Kay|Lea Ra-Kay]] and there causes [[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] and [[../People/Ba'an Ty|Ba'an Ty]] to call in the implied favour that David Atkinson offered for transport.

Jonathan and Ba'an are picked up by the feline [[../People/Ria|Ria]] in a low powered atmosphere shuttle and taken to [[../Ships/Basilica (Starship)|Basilica (Starship)]] where they realise that the Follower cult are a lot better equipped than they pretended to be.

The Brick home world has been attacked by a technology dampening weapon deployed by Thinkers, which causes them to sustain a lot of devastation. Jon and [[../People/Ria|Ria]] take an unusual trip to the planet and retrieve [[../People/Ka'ona Michaels (Kay)|Ka'ona Michaels (Kay)]] and Libby's avatar. 

Events lead, one to the next until, following odd clues to the edge of the universe, [[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] is led to a small empty planet at the edge of space where he meets [[../People/Gower Saint|Gower Saint]] someone from is distant past. 

The [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinker (Race)]] tried an elaborate plan to capture [[../People/Gower Saint|Gower Saint]] and ascend him to godhood in order to return the [[../Races and factions/Blade (Race)|Blade (Race)]] to reality and assumingly dominate the known galaxy.

The resulting battle results in the end of the [[../Races and factions/Thinker (Race)|Thinker (Race)]] and the war, at great cost to all.
