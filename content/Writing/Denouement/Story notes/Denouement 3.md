# üí° Details
The story stats an undefined amount of time after [[Denouement 2]] and just after [[Tales of 1]] 
[[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]], [[../People/Libby Michaels|Libby Michaels]], [[../People/Ria|Ria]] and [[../People/Ba'an Ty|Ba'an Ty]] are investigating a planet they refer to as [[../Places/Earth 2 (planet)|Earth 2 (planet)]] which is a 'spare' Earth, that, they assume was stored by [[../People/Aygah|Aygah]] as a backup. Earth 2 is has technology and culture similar to 2020 Earth, though the Denouemeverse  experienced this timeframe.

All the food and drink on Earth 2 is bland and lacks flavour or nutritional value.

Their task on the planet is scanning for a mysterious frequency burst which should not be on the planet. 

While there, they meet [[../People/Lilly Michaels|Lilly Michaels]] and [[../People/Ryan|Ryan]] in a coffee shop. 

After a random act of violence from the natives, outside a pub, a video is recorded and the team are challenged the next day by  [[../People/Lilly Michaels|Lilly Michaels]] and [[../People/Ryan|Ryan]] - due to a combination of apathy, boredom and a gut feeling, Jon reveals that he is an alien and tells them everything. 

Once Jon's new friends are convinced, they join the team on [[../Ships/Basilica (Starship)|Basilica (Starship)]] where there is some strange medica data taken from Lilly.

>The spoils beyond this point are REAL

Upon returning to Earth 2 it is discovered that [[../People/Ryan|Ryan]] is a robot (of some sort) who attacks the team. At the end of the fight the team leave the planet.

[[../People/Ba'an Ty|Ba'an Ty]] has been trying to get the [[../Races and factions/Brick (Race)|Brick (Race)]] to send a "welcome team" to the planet to save them from themselves but has not had good responses. 

It is discovered that [[../People/Lilly Michaels|Lilly Michaels]] has an implant in her brain as well as the shock that she is [[../Races and factions/Bio-static (sub-race)|Bio-static (sub-race)]] 

After teaching her what his means [[../People/Jonathan Michaels (Jon)|Jonathan Michaels (Jon)]] takes her on an adventure to follow the signal where he finds an artefact of [[../People/Aygah|Aygah]] which teleports away, leaving them on a moon.

On the moon, Lily is attacked and shows strange abilities which she can not have access to. 

This leads Jon to reach out to [[../People/Ashley|Ashley]]
