# üí° Details
## "WEEK"
A collection of 5 short stories. Each one takes place on a different day beginning on Monday and ending on Friday. 

The overall story explores the universe through the eyes of main characters, showing the differences between them day by day. 

The major connecting thread between the stories is a device created on Monday by Libby and [[../People/Doors|Doors]] called a 'Pianyes'  which begins as an instrument but slowly becomes a device for seeing your inner self.

The device is incredibly popular with [[../Races and factions/Brick (Race)|Brick (Race)]] and is reproduced as an entertainment device, which is well received as a glimmer of hope. 

The series also tackles the emotional trauma that [[../People/Lea Ra-Kay|Lea Ra-Kay]] has undergone since the events of [[Denouement 2]]. This also form a bond between her and Kay.

The last story ends with [[../People/Joanne Michaels (Jo)|Joanne Michaels (Jo)]] proposing marriage to [[../People/Ashley|Ashley]]
