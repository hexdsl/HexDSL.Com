I have tried with this social media stuff but honestly, at this point I have realised that even a toe dipped in the water makes me feel like I've wasted time. I have resolved that I am no longer engaging with it. 

 I'm on Discord, because that's where my pals are! also, I sort of microblog to this site, as stream of ideas, I suppose. 
- [Discord](https://discord.hexdsl.com) - Where I chat with people!
- [[Micro Blog|Obsidilog]] - Where I talk to myself. *<- Honestly, I enjoy doing this far more than I thought I would* ðŸ¥°

That's about it really. *Oh* and you should email 
hexdsl@gmail.com
If you want.
