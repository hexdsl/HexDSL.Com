I have tried with this social media stuff, but honestly, at this point I have realised that even a toe dipped in the water makes me feel like I've wasted time. I have resolved that I am no longer engaging with it. 

 I'm on Discord because that's where my pals are! Also, I sort of microblog.
- [Discord](https://discord.hexdsl.com) - Where I chat with people!
- [Micro Blog](https://getupnote.com/share/notes/AUiZ14tRv0anStjXFyr6Xg51TGB3/3d37c69e-e152-4dee-a1cb-e63fd10b8c94) - Where I talk to myself. ðŸ¥°

That's about it really. *Oh,* and you should email me at, hexdsl@gmail.com if you'd like.
